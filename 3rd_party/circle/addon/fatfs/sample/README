README

This sample program creates a listing of the files in the root directory of the
inserted SD card (WHICH DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY IMPORTANT DATA). The first primary
partition of the SD card must be a FAT partition. Extended partitions or other
file systems are not supported.

After creating the directory listing a file "circle.txt" is created in the root
directory and some text is written to it. After closing the file it is re-opened
and its contents is read and written to the screen.

If you change the #define DRIVE to "USB:" in kernel.cpp you can access an USB
drive instead of the SD card.

This sample uses the FatFs generic FAT file system module (R0.12c), which is
Copyright (C) 2017, ChaN, all right reserved. FatFs supports long file names
(LFN), subdirectories, the full set of features of the FAT file system and has a
better performance than the Circle FAT file system library. That's why FatFs has
been ported to Circle. Please see the project page for detailed information and
documentation of the user API of FatFs:

	http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html

FatFs has been configured to use code page 850 (Latin 1) in ffconf.h, which is
the character code used throughout Circle. FatFs provides support for code pages
932 (Japanese Shift_JIS), 936 (Simplified Chinese GBK), 949 (Korean) and 950
(Traditional Chinese Big5) too. Because Circle itself does not support these and
to save space this is not included here.
